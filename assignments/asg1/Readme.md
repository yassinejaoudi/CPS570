## Code Output:


## Goal of this part 2 of the assignment:
### hw1.exe 10 URL-input-100.txt
![Goal](part3_goal_output1.png)

## Lessons learned and trace:
* Git version control has been utilized and learned from the team members for better collaboration.
* Team building aspects and workflow has been learned as we have a great team that is motivated to do the work, be there when another member of the team needs help with a certain task, and finish with great results.
* Frequent and great communication throughout the team using zoom meeting or group chat.
* Debbuging techniques.
* Time management.
* :rotating_light: We need to add the technical lessons learned in this asg :rotating_light:
* Single-Threading/ Multi-Threading concepts
* GET Request procedures
* Parsing webpages

## Google graph-size analysis:

## Yahoo bandwidth analysis:

## Probability analysis:

## Tasks done from previous assignment part:



## :sparkles: Future Work :sparkles:

* Find a way to specify the buffer size dynamically.
* Current code runtime is **118.58 ms**, we will be improving this runtime by making the code more effecient in order to decrease the runtime.
* Improve the overall design of the code.
